# Ultimate fully customizable swatches holder generator

This is an [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) script to generate filament and infill swatches tiles holder. Holders generated with the default settings are fully compatible with [Bambu Lab sample swatches](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-filament-swatches) , swatches generated by my other project [Ultimate fully customizable swatches generator](https://github.com/zizzo81/swatches) and are the full compatible parametrization of the [Swatch Display Board by Bambu Lab](https://makerworld.com/en/models/14863#profileId-14645), **any** parameter of the swatches and holder can be changed.

This script has been published and can be found and used directly on [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en)'s [page](https://makerworld.com/en/models/488028).

## A guide through the tabs of parameters

### 3D printing settings

| Parameter      | Description                                                  | default       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| print_mode     | Switches between modes of generation.<br />- **Monochromatic** - generates the full body with holder, chiseled and extruded texts.<br />- **Holder only** - generates the body of the holder with chiseled texts, but not extruded texts which can be lately added with the next option.<br />- **Texts only** - generates only chiseled and extruded texts, this can be used to create a multicolor object. | Monochromatic |
| curves_quality | Selects the quality of curves to be used when generating the model, the lowest the quality, the faster generation will take. You can work in Draft all the time for fast refresh, but you need to remember to switch back to Normal or something higher before exporting the model to be printed.<br /><br />Possible values:<br />- **Draft** - low quality, not suitable for printing;<br />- **Printable draft** - not for production, yet printable;<br />- **Normal**: normal quality, ready to print;<br />- **High quality**: good quality for high resolution printers.<br /><br />**Be warned:** Parametric Model Maker has a short timeout for script execution to avoid DDoS attacks, for this reason setting a quality too high could create a timeout error | Normal        |

## What you can create

### Monochromatic holders

The easiest one, nothing to say: create a holder the way you want it.

![Parametric Model Maker](./Guide/mono_online_editor.png)An example holder to be printed using a single color.

![print_mode set to Monochromatic](./Guide/print_mode_monochromatic.png)

Make sure you selected **Monochromatic** for the parameter **print_mode** in the **3D printing settings** tab as shown in the image above.

Remember to left click on ![Generate](./Guide/generate_button.png) to generate a version with your current settings.

Click on the ![Download](./Guide/download_button.png) button to download the object to a file.

![Download format selection](./Guide/format_selection.png)

When this windows pops up, left click on the ![Download STL](./Guide/download_stl_button.png) button to select the .STL file format.

![Save as monochromatic.stl](./Guide/mono_save_as.png)

If your computer offers the possibility to save the file to a desired location, select a folder where you want to save it and choose a proper name, e. g. “monochromatic”, which fill create “monochromatic.stl”.

If your browser is configured to automatically save files, you will find the file named “Swatches holder.stl” in the location you usually receive downloaded file, usually called the “Downloads” folder.

![Drrag'n'drop monochromatic.stl over Bambu Studio](./Guide/mono_dragndrop.png)
Open [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio) or your preferred slicer, start a new project and drag the file onto it.

![Example of a printed monochromatic holder](./Guide/mono_holder.jpg)

Sample result of the above operations.

### Multi color holders on mono printers or for non AMS compatible filaments (using pause at layer/height)

Please read the *Monochromatic holders* section for basic information about how to manage the whole process before continuing.

A limitation of the monochromatic printer can be partially bypassed, printing the texts with another color by using some clever tricks, here's how to do it.

![Parametric Model maker](./Guide/color_editor.png)
First of all make sure you designed your holder with all the texts as extruded, chiseled texts will not be colored.

Export it as STL and import into Bambu Studio following the same instructions for monochromatic printing until you reach the step where you slice it.

![Bambu Studio slice preview](./Guide/bambu_studio_color_preview_0.png)
Once you sliced the plate, use drag the **+** icon of the vertical scrollbar down.

![The + icon in the vertical scrollbar](./Guide/bambu_studio_vertical_scrollbar_20.png)

As you scroll top layers will disappear from view, continue scrolling down until only one layer with texts is visible.

![Bambu Studio slice preview at layer 19](./Guide/bambu_studio_color_preview_1.png)
Now, right click on the **+** icon and a menu will pop out.

![Popup menu on vertical scrollbar](./Guide/bambu_studio_vertical_scrollbar_19.png)

Select the **Add Pause** item, the you will have to slice the plate again.

![Bambu Studio slice preview with pause at layer](./Guide/bambu_studio_color_preview_2.png)

Once you sliced it again, the scrollbar will show a “Pause” label where you set it and the layer will be drawn with another color.

Now print this, when the printer is starting to print that layer, it will pause and the print head will be moved away from the piece and on the screen you will see a message.

![Display of Bambu Lab X1C showing Pause at layer alert](./Guide/pause_at_layer.jpg)

Change the filament in the printer, then press **Resume** to continue printing using the new color.

![Example of a printed holder with two colors](./Guide/color_holder.jpg)

In my opinion, results are beautiful.

## Multi color holders on multi color printers

Please read the *Monochromatic holders* section for basic information about how to manage the whole process before continuing.

 

The most easy way to print these, yet the most satisfying way to customize this.

![print_mode set to Holder only](./Guide/print_mode_holder_only.png)


Once you draw your holder, be sure to select the **Holder only** option for the **print_mode** parameter in the **3D printing settings** tab and click on **Generate**.

![Parametric Model Maker](./Guide/holder_only_editor.png)
Click the **Download** button to export to a STL file, let's say holder.stl.

![print_mode set to Texts only](./Guide/print_mode_texts_only.png)

Change the **print_mode** parameter to **Texts only** and click **Generate** button again.

![Parametric Model Maker](./Guide/texts_only_editor.png)
Click **Download** again and export this to a STL file and call it texts.stl.

![Drag'n'drop both files into Bambu Studio](./Guide/multicolor_dragndrop.png)
Open a new project in Bambu Studio and drag both file at the same time on it.

![Load these files as a single object with multiple parts? - Yes](./Guide/load_as_single_object.png)

When asked if these has to be considered two parts of a single object, select **Yes**.

![Bambu Studio change colors](./Guide/bambu_studio_multicolor.png)
Now follow these steps:

1. Switch to the **Objects** tab by left clicking on the Global/Objects switch;
2. Right click on the texts.stl line in the objects list;
3. Move with the mouse over the **Change filament** menu item;
4. From the sub menu select the filament you want.

This procedure has been designed to work with both chiseled and extruded modes.
